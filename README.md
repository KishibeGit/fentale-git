## Restaurant Page

This is a simple restaurant page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and bundled using webpack. The page is rendered dynamically by using JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.

This project was built to demonstrate the skills and concepts of ES6 modules, webpack, and code organization. It was developed as part of The Odin Project's full-stack web development curriculum.

The Menu section displays a list of menu items, the Reservation displays a form to book a table and the Contact section displays the restaurant's contact information.
